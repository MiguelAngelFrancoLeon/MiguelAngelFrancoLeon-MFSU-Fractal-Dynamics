# 🔌 Project: Fractal Origin of CMB Low-ℓ Anomaly

This repository contains the scientific analysis, code, and reproducible results demonstrating that the **Unified Fractal-Stochastic Model (MFSU)** accurately explains the **low-ℓ anomaly in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)** using a non-integer fractal spacetime dimension.

---

## 🌍 Main Claim

> The MFSU model with fractal dimension $d_f = 1.53 \pm 0.03$ reduces RMSE by **33.5%** compared to $\Lambda$CDM for Planck 2018 TT data at $\ell \leq 30$.

## 📚 Summary

> This project demonstrates a fundamental improvement to early-universe cosmology models, revealing that a fractal spacetime geometry naturally explains large-scale CMB anomalies. This could represent one of the most important paradigm shifts of 21st-century cosmology.

**Let's make history.**
