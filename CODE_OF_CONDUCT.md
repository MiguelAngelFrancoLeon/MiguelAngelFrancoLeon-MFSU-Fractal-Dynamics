# Code of Conduct - MFSU Project

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers of the Unified Fractal-Stochastic Model (MFSU) project pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behavior Examples

* **Scientific Rigor**: Using welcoming and inclusive language while maintaining scientific accuracy
* **Open Collaboration**: Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences in scientific discourse
* **Constructive Criticism**: Providing constructive feedback on scientific methodology and results
* **Community Focus**: Focusing on what is best for the scientific community and reproducible research
* **Empathy**: Showing empathy towards other community members and their scientific contributions
* **Knowledge Sharing**: Actively sharing knowledge, data, and methodologies following open science principles

### Unacceptable Behavior Examples

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' scientific work or personal information without explicit permission
* **Scientific Misconduct**: Falsifying data, plagiarizing research, or misrepresenting results
* **Bad Faith Criticism**: Attacking research without scientific basis or constructive purpose
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional scientific setting

## Scientific Ethics

As a scientific project, we hold ourselves to additional standards:

### Research Integrity
* **Reproducibility**: All code, data, and methods must be clearly documented and reproducible
* **Data Transparency**: Raw data and processing steps should be made available when possible
* **Peer Review**: We welcome constructive scientific criticism and peer review
* **Attribution**: Proper citation and attribution of all sources and collaborations

### Open Science Commitment
* **Open Access**: Research outputs should be freely available to the scientific community
* **Collaborative Development**: We encourage collaborative development and improvement of the MFSU framework
* **Educational Purpose**: Supporting educational use and understanding of fractal-stochastic models

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [miguelangelfrancoleon@example.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Scientific Dispute Resolution

For disputes related to scientific methodology, interpretation of results, or theoretical disagreements:

1. **Issue Discussion**: Open a GitHub issue for transparent discussion
2. **Peer Review**: Request review from qualified domain experts
3. **Data Verification**: Provide additional data or analysis to support claims
4. **Community Feedback**: Allow time for community input and review
5. **Collaborative Resolution**: Work towards consensus or agree to disagree scientifically

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 1.4, and includes additional scientific ethics guidelines specific to the MFSU project.
